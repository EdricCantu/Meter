# This directory is for running proxy servers on the same device that's metered.
  since we're metered, just like the client (we're probably on the same device as the client), we have to be mindful of our data usage, and depending on the mode, we can only avoid what isn't necessary, like advertisements and preloaded videos

(on the metered device, )
* if text mode is used, this will usually consume similar data to that of running an unmetered-server, otherwise, more
* if minimal mode or complete mode is used, this will always consume more data than running an unmetered-server
