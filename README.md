# Meter
Meter meters your meeter meter over metered connections

Metered Transmission Relay files (.mtr) basically shortened Meter files
show how one can access such content easily over metered connections
without worry of what it might cost in terms of data

It works (WIP, *should* work) with a device on a metered connection *AND* on an unmetered server device to proxy the data and shorten it
